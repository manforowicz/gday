## Running a server

One of the strengths of gday is its decentralized nature.
[/gday_hole_punch/src/server_connector.rs](/gday_hole_punch/src/server_connector.rs)
has a list of default servers that can be use for sharing socket addresses with a peer.

Want to add your own server to the list? Here are the high-level steps:

1. Get a [virtual private server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (VPS) from a hosting service. It must have public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and not be behind NAT.
2. Buy/configure a domain name to point at your VPS.
3. On the VPS, get a TLS certificate using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) with your domain name.
4. On the VPS, use a tool such as `wget` to download gday_server from the [releases page](https://github.com/manforowicz/gday/releases).
5. On the VPS, run `gday_server` with the correct TLS arguments.
6. On a local device, verify you can use `gday` with your server domain name passed as an argument.
7. On the VPS, follow instructions in [/other/gday_server.service](/other/gday_server.service) to set up a [systemd service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html).
8. Verify `gday_server` auto-starts in the background, even when you reboot the server.
9. Submit an [issue](https://github.com/manforowicz/gday/issues), asking for your server to be added to the [default server list](/gday_hole_punch/src/server_connector.rs).
